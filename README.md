# Miscellaneous

This folder is basically for small side-projects that I did using JavaScript based tech and libraries ; ranging from **DOM-Manipulation** to **NodeJS** ! Each folder is a self-contained separate project which can be downloaded and used separately. Feel free to use any piece of code here for personal/commercial purposes
